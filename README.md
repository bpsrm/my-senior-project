# My Senior Project [VoiceBrary]
###### People with disabilities are people who have limitations in their lives. Therefore, there must be various devices to help with life, for example, the hearing impaired will have a hearing aid that can make them hear, the visually impaired will have a cane to help them travel, etc. Therefore, the VoiceBrary web application has been developed to help the visually impaired who want to read but cannot see. This website will smoothly read various books for the visually impaired.
